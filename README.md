# Step-Counter
## *(project is incomplete, and currently paused)*
This is a sample step-counter app.

It tracks/counts the user's steps, for as long as they want, and displays different days and the steps of that day.

It uses most of the latest Android Architecture tools and best practises, such as Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Kotlin Coroutines.

It's an on-going project, and basically my introduction to the aforementioned practises and tools, so be kind :D
